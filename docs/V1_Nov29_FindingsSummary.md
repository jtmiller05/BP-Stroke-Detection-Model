# Initial Stroke Prediction Model Development (V1)

## Overview
Our first iteration implemented two distinct approaches for stroke prediction: a Neural Network and an XGBoost model. Both models were trained and evaluated on the Stroke Prediction Dataset, providing valuable insights into the challenges of medical prediction tasks.

## Results and Analysis

### Neural Network Performance
Training Metrics:
- Accuracy: 0.9516
- Precision: 0.5385
- Recall: 0.0352
- F1 Score: 0.0660
- ROC AUC: 0.9017

Test Metrics:
- Accuracy: 0.9491
- Precision: 0.0000
- Recall: 0.0000
- F1 Score: 0.0000
- ROC AUC: 0.7969

The neural network's performance reveals several critical issues:
- The model fails completely on the test set, with zero precision and recall, indicating it's not predicting any stroke cases
- Despite high accuracy (94.91%), the model is essentially useless for stroke prediction as it's likely predicting "no stroke" for all cases
- The significant gap between training and test performance (particularly in precision and recall) indicates severe overfitting
- While the ROC AUC remains relatively high (0.7969), this is misleading given the complete failure in actual predictions

### XGBoost Performance
Training Metrics:
- Accuracy: 0.9574
- Precision: 0.5335
- Recall: 1.0000
- F1 Score: 0.6958
- ROC AUC: 0.9990

Test Metrics:
- Accuracy: 0.9237
- Precision: 0.2879
- Recall: 0.3800
- F1 Score: 0.3276
- ROC AUC: 0.8230

The XGBoost results, while better, show their own challenges:
- Perfect recall (100%) in training vs 38% in testing indicates significant overfitting
- However, it maintains some predictive power on the test set, unlike the neural network
- Lower precision (28.79%) suggests high false positive rate, but at least it's identifying some true stroke cases
- The model shows better generalization than the neural network, though still needs improvement

## Key Findings from Metric Analysis

1. Severe Model Failure:
- Neural network completely fails on test data, suggesting fundamental issues in our approach
- The high accuracy is misleading due to class imbalance in the dataset
- XGBoost shows better robustness but still suffers from significant overfitting

2. Class Imbalance Impact:
- Both models achieve high accuracy (~95%) by favoring the majority class
- Neural network fails to learn meaningful patterns for stroke prediction
- XGBoost manages to maintain some predictive ability despite imbalance

3. Model Stability:
- Neural network shows complete instability between training and test performance
- XGBoost shows overfitting but maintains useful predictive capability
- Neither model achieves acceptable performance for medical applications

## Planned Improvements for V2

1. Critical Model Fixes:
- Completely redesign neural network architecture and training approach
- Implement robust class balancing techniques (SMOTE, class weights)
- Consider architectural changes to handle imbalanced data better

2. Data Processing Enhancements:
- Investigate data quality and representation of stroke cases
- Implement stratified sampling to maintain class distribution
- Consider data augmentation for minority class

3. Training Strategy:
- Implement class weights in both models
- Add regularization to prevent overfitting
- Consider ensemble approaches combining multiple models

## Conclusion
Our initial results highlight severe issues, particularly with the neural network's complete failure on test data. While XGBoost shows more promise, both models require significant improvements before being viable for medical applications. The next iteration will focus on fundamental redesign of our approach, with particular emphasis on handling class imbalance and ensuring model stability.
